# Yearly Trends of Common Birds at Manassas National Battlefield Park (2007-2017)
[Google CoLab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vmagdangal/MANA-bird-sightings-CoLab/blob/main/2007_2017_MANA_Bird_Sightings.ipynb)

## Overview
Attached are the input CSV to run the analysis and a cleaned CSV that contains the final cleaned dataset that the plots use.

This is a Google CoLab analysis notebook, where this dataset from [data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ncrn-bird-monitoring-data-2007-2017) contains NCRN Bird Monitoring Data from 2007-2017. While the complete dataset includes multiple parks, this analysis focuses on the observations from the forest plots at Manassas National Battlefield Park (MANA) during breeding seasons in May-July.

## Usage
Click into the `2007_2017_MANA_Bird_Sightings.ipynb` file in the repository (or at the above link!), and you will be able to both view the notebook or navigate into it.

If you want to run the Notebook, you will have to upload `MANA Bird Monitoring Data.csv` into the notebook at the comment under the Fetching Data section.
